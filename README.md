# 👋 Hi, I'm Carson Eelman

I'm a mechanical engineer currently pursuing my master's degree. I enjoy solving real-world problems through design, prototyping, and simulation—whether it's for aerospace systems or healthcare innovation.

## 🔭 Projects I'm Working On

### 🔬 AirCue – Compact Inhaler Spacer  
I’m the developer of AirCue, a next-generation spacer that improves medication delivery using optimized internal geometry. The goal is to provide better treatment efficiency in a much smaller, more portable device.  
> Proof-of-concept prototypes have been tested for flow behavior and form factor. The design continues to evolve with simulation-backed refinement.

### 🚀 Aerospace & CFD Studies  
My background in undergrad focused heavily on aerospace applications. I’ve conducted research involving rocket nozzle optimization and external aerodynamic simulations.  
> Tools used include ANSYS Fluent, MATLAB, and a range of CAD platforms to study flow characteristics and structural performance.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
I’m currently exploring ways to make technical data more engaging and accessible through visual storytelling. This includes using tools like ggplot2, plotly, and Quarto in R for clearer communication of simulation and test results.

## 🤔 I’m Looking For Help With
I am currently needing help validating aerosol based drug delivery and training sensors using BME AI-Studio.
